At the end of this message, I will ask you to do something. Please follow the "PR Work" workflow when you start.

# PR Work

Write up a short report that could be used as the PR description. Include what has been done, the choices you made with their brief justification, and any commands you ran in the process that may be useful for future developers to know about.

Do not include any emojis or icons in the report. Make it looks like its written by the developer itself.

Add a mermaid diagram only if needed. 

All all this into a new PR.md file

If you identify knowledge that might be valuable for future work, write those learnings in a succinct and direct manner to a CLAUDE.md file in the root of the project directory.
