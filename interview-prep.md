At the end of this message, I will give you my resume txt file and a job description(JD) link. Please follow the "Parallels, Cheat sheet, My questions" workflow when you start.

# Parallels
Using my provided resume and the job description (JD) linked below, identify 5–7 key parallels between my experience and the JD’s requirements. Highlight specific strengths, skills, or achievements to emphasize in interviews. Generate 8–10 practice interview questions based on the JD, focusing on both technical and behavioral competencies. Review my resume’s behavioral story (if present) and suggest 2–3 specific improvements to make it more compelling, focusing on impact and strategic thinking.

# Cheat Sheet
Create a concise "cheat sheet" with 15–20 behavioral stories tailored to the JD’s core competencies. Each story should:
- Focus on strategic thinking, leadership, and high-impact outcomes (e.g., driving team/company success) rather than routine tactical tasks.
- Be formatted as a bullet point with a brief title, a 1–2 sentence summary, and the specific skill or competency it demonstrates.
- Be designed for quick recall during interviews, enabling me to confidently narrate the story without referring to the sheet.
- Align with common skills in the JD, such as problem-solving, innovation, or cross-functional collaboration.

# My Questions
Suggest 4–6 strategic questions I can ask during the HR screen to:
- Highlight strengths from my resume that align with the hiring manager’s priorities.
- Address potential concerns about my candidacy (e.g., gaps, fit, or experience) proactively.
- Gain insights into the hiring team’s evaluation criteria or reservations about my profile.
- Demonstrate my fit for the role and company culture, helping me tailor my responses in future rounds.

# Write up your work
- When you are happy with your analysis, write up a prep.md file to me to follow up.

If you identify knowledge that might be valuable for future work, write those learnings in a succinct and direct manner to a CLAUDE.md file in the root of the project directory.
